# task-2
Objective:
Analyze a dataset using statistics and visualizations to understand its structure and uncover patterns.

Tools:
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Steps:

Generate summary stats (mean, median, std, etc.)

Create histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and correlation matrix

Identify trends, outliers, and relationships

Key Activities:

Generate Summary Statistics:
Compute metrics like mean, median, standard deviation, and more to understand the central tendency and spread of the data.

Visualizations:

Histograms and Boxplots to examine distributions and detect outliers.

Pairplots and Correlation Matrix to explore relationships between features.

Pattern Recognition:
Identify trends, correlations, anomalies, or clusters in the data.

Feature-Level Inference:
Draw basic conclusions from the statistics and plots, such as which features might influence the target variable.
